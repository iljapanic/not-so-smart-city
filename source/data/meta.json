	"abstract": "This paper argues that existing approaches to smart city design are rooted in a techno-centric mindset that is not suitable for urban problems that are inherently social. The paper first examines the problematic aspects of the current smart city discourse driven primarily by business interests. It then critically analyses underlying principles of the dominant data-driven smart city ideology, followed by an alternative vision of smart city based on citizen engagement.",
